## Write complete script that will solve the following problems. 
Make sure to write complete scripts with appropriate comments. 
Attach copies of each script to this lab sheet (as lab4_a.py ... lab4_c.py)
Remember to utilize the following:

def main():
        Main code block goes here

if __name__ ==  ‘__main__’:
        main()

## Questions:
### A. Read in three numbers from the keyboard.
Determine which number is the largest and which number is the smallest and print these values to the screen with an appropriate message.
### B. Create a list containing the names of several programming languages. 
Prompt the user for their favorite programming language and determine if that language is present in the list. 
If the language is a member of the list, print out a message, otherwise add the language to the list.
### C. Given a fulcrum system like the one to the right (SEE [4.b.i](https://github.com/sudoCreate258/csc138_lab4/assets/59755293/a455ac0b-8dc0-4db7-84b4-e3c8f7c182a4)), 
Write a complete script that determines whether the system will balance. 
At the keyboard, prompt the user for the values for the two weights and distances, and output whether or not the systems will balance. 
Recall that the system will balance when w 1 x d 1 = w 2 x d 2 (you may assume that the balance beam has no weight).
